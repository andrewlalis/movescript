# About Movescript

Movescript is a set of libraries that remove the prohibitive tedium of writing turtle code by hand. It consists of the following modules:

| Module                      | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Movescript](./movescript/) | A small scripting language to simplify repetitive turtle tasks.      |
| [Itemscript](./itemscript/) | A collection of helper functions that simplify inventory management. |

These modules are intended to be used with the Turtle robots provided by the [CC:Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/) mod for Minecraft.

You can run an installer script to automatically download the latest versions of all of the movescript family of libraries:
```shell
wget run https://andrewlalis.github.io/movescript/scripts/ms-installer.lua
```
